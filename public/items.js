// A *task* in this codebase is a checklist line in a PR description (tasks.js);
// an *item* is a row of the queue, which is this.
//
// The queue is yours, so these tabs are states of your own list and nothing
// else. Work carried to the PR description or an issue is not a flag here: it
// has left the queue (moveOut in server.js), which is what drains Local, and a
// session that ended tidily leaves it empty.
